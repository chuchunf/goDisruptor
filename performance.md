## Introduction
The LMAX Disruptor is a high-performance inter-thread messaging library developed in Java, renowned for its exceptionally low latency  
by using lock-free algorithms, careful memory layout and other consideration at hardware level to minimize contention and improve the throughput.

The objective of the port is to learn to implement, test and verify low latency library in general, as golang prefers goroutine.
As Go provides powerful built-in primitives like channels and goroutines.

This documents covers the performance analysis of this Go port of the LMAX Disruptor.
